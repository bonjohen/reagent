# Folder Rename Summary: research_agent â†’ reagents

## Changes Made

I've updated the codebase to reflect the folder rename from "research_agent" to "reagents". Here's what was done:

1. **Updated import statements** in Python files to use the new module name
2. **Created a new test directory structure** at tests/unit/reagents
3. **Updated configuration files** like pytest.ini
4. **Updated documentation** in README.md, FIXES.md, and docs/ files

## Remaining Tasks

There are a few things that still need attention:

1. **Run the tests** to verify everything works correctly:
   ```
   pytest
   ```

2. **Check for any missed references** to "research_agent" in the codebase:
   ```
   findstr /s "research_agent" *.py *.md
   ```

3. **Remove the old test directory** if it still exists:
   ```
   powershell -Command "Remove-Item -Path 'tests\unit\research_agent' -Recurse -Force"
   ```

## Potential Issues

1. **Import errors**: If you encounter import errors when running tests or the application, check for any missed import statements that still reference "research_agent"

2. **Path references**: Some files might contain hardcoded paths that reference the old folder structure

3. **Documentation references**: There might be more references to "research_agent" in documentation files

## Recommendations

1. **Update .gitignore**: Make sure your .gitignore file is updated to ignore the new virtual environment name if you're using "venv_reagent" instead of "venv_research_agent"

2. **Update any CI/CD configurations**: If you have CI/CD pipelines, make sure they reference the new folder structure

3. **Consider updating the project name**: If this is part of a larger rebranding, you might want to update the project name in other places like package.json, setup.py, etc.
